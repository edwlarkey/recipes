# Chocolate Chip Scones

## Ingredients:

* 1 3/4 cup flour
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1 pinch of salt
* 5 tbsp. butter, chilled and shredded/cubed
* 1/2 cup chocolate chips
* 1/2 cup cream

## Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 400 F. Spray a baking sheet with a cooking spray.
1. In a large bowl whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
1. With a pastry blender or a large fork cut in the shredded butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
1. Stir in chocolate chips. Mix in the cream to form a dough.
1. Turn out the dough on a floured surface. Pat or roll into a 9 inch circle about 1/2 inch thick. Cut out 12 scones, pushing the dough scraps together for the last few. Transfer the scones to the baking sheet.
