Easter is a bright, joyful and family holiday to me. I’m Russian Orthodox and my family always celebrated this day with Pascha bread and dyed eggs.  We put the icon of Christ in front of the bread and eggs overnight and in the morning cut the bread at the breakfast together. Then, of course, everyone would have an egg fight! We would hit each other’s eggs and then see whose egg was intact after the fightfile](/img/image-1399857786979.png)

Here’s the recipe for traditional Easter bread, or as we call it most often - Pascha.

Ingredients:

* 3/4 cup butter, room temperature
* 1 1/2 cup warm milk
* 1 tbsp. salt
* 1 cup sugar + 1 tbsp.
* 2 pkgs. dry yeast
* 6 eggs, slightly beaten
* 8 cups flour
* 1 tsp. vanilla
* 1/2 cup raisins, washed, optional
* white cake frosting

Directions:

1. Dissolve yeast in warm milk and 1 tbsp. of sugar. Wait for it to rise, about 15 min.
1. Add butter salt, sugar, and vanilla. Mix well.
1. Stir in eggs.
1. Add flour and raisins.
1. Knead until smooth and elastic. Dough should be lighter than for regular bread.
1. Let rise covered with plastic wrap in warm place until doubled.
1. Punch down, divide and let rise again until doubled in the greased tall empty and clean coffee cans. (Yes, that’s what I usedDon’t put too much dough in one can, or it will fall over when being baked.
1. Place in 325 F preheated oven for 45-60 min or until the wooden stick inserted in the bread comes out clean.
1. Let cool for at least an hour.
1. Cover with heated white cake frosting so that it drips down the bread a little.
1. Decorate with letters “XB” on top of the bread (with sprinkles or raisins) which means Christ is Risen
